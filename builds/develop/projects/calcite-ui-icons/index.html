        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Symbology and iconography were inconsistent across the platform, causing confusion with actions or visual aids</li>
            <li>There was no centralized location to find icons</li> 
            <li>No single location of record for existing icons. Therefore, multiple icons of the same concept were created. For example, two trash can icons for delete in different styles</li>
            <li>Because at times multiple icons were created there were conflicting icon concepts. Moreover, time spent creating inconsistent concepts and opportunity cost to solve other problems. Resulting in higher costs</li>
            <li>There was no easy way to get updates or new icons. Once the static icon file was downloaded it instantly because stagnant and out of date</li>
            <li>Method of icon design delivery often consistent of zipped file email</li>
        </ol>
