            <h1>Programs Dashboard</h1>
            <p>This is an executive dashboard I created for managers, executives and CTOs of Esri. It is the centalized location for all Programs I manage as the Design Program Manager. It holds key high level infomration to keep stakeholders informed and the status of all programs.</p>

        <h2>Need for this project</h2>
        <p>When I started my new role as Design Program Manager in 2018, there were not processes or tools in place for managing or directing programs. Moreover, no tools to keep management informed of the progress. The purpose of this dashboard is to keep management, as well as everyone at the company, informed about Calcite programs. The objective of Calcite is to create a centralized design system and language, which will enable standardization, consistency, and harmonization through the ArcGIS platform and all other Esri initiatives.</p>

        <h3>Requirments and features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Overview of resrouces allocated to each program and overall percentage allocation</li>
            <li>Display number of outstanding, in progress, and completed tasks per individual program</li>
            <li>Design and development phase of individual programs</li>
            <li>Percentage completion of individual programs</li>
            <li>List of internal and external stakholders for each program</li>
            <li>List of designers and developers working on each program</li>
            <li>iframe of prototypes, builds, designs or invision prototypes</li>
            <li>Interactive so that you can jump between programs and quickly get the high level statistics</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tools used</h2>
        <p>There are quite a few of data visualization and dashboard solutions out there. Moreover, since the data I'm trying to display isn't geographic data, there are no restictions to using Esri software. However, in attempts to show colleagues and partners at the company that our software can be used with non-geographic datasets, I leveraged <a href="../dashboard/index.html">Operations Dashboard for ArcGIS</a> for this project. Though there were some chanllenged is the way my dataset was structured, I was able to successfully build out my dashboard.</p>

        <p>I also needed to integrate issues from Github projects. I was able to export a JSON file of all the github issues, dump it on a web server and use python to parse the issues and categorize them appropriately. From there, they got pushed to a hosted table on ArcGIS Online and I wa able to import that layer into my dashboard.</p>

        <h2>Project outcomes</h2>
        <p>Below are a few screenshots of the Dashboard.</p>
