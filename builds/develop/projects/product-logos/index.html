        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Symbology and iconography were inconsistent across the platform, causing confusion with actions or visual aids</li>
            <li>There was no centralized location to find icons</li> 
            <li>No single location of record for existing icons. Therefore, multiple icons of the same concept were created. For example, two trash can icons for delete in different styles</li>
            <li>Because at times multiple icons were created there were conflicting icon concepts. Moreover, time spent creating inconsistent concepts and opportunity cost to solve other problems. Resulting in higher costs</li>
            <li>There was no easy way to get updates or new icons. Once the static icon file was downloaded it instantly because stagnant and out of date</li>
            <li>Method of icon design delivery often consistent of zipped file email</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The solution</h2>
        <p>A centralized repository of icons hosted on Github.com. Moreover, the repository is public facing, meaning our distributors, partners, and customers can leverage Esri's custom-built iconography. Therefore, Esri will set the standard of GIS and mapping icons, which can be adopted by everyone. Additionally, the repository can be sourced vis NPM, so that whenever there is a new release of icons users will be notified of updates, deletion or additions to the library. This will ensure that everyone leveraging this icons system is always up to date with the latest. Creating consistency across the platform. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Icons come in two styles: outline and filled (bold)</li>
            <li>Icons available in 3 sizes (16, 24, and 32)</li>
            <li>All icons come with search tags to ensure users are using the appropriate concept</li>
            <li>There are also SVG sprites with all icons</li>
            <li>`Spriter` CLI took available for building sprites of only the icons needed</li>
            <li>Over 300 icon concepts</li>
        </ul>
