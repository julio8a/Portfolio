         		 <h1>Hello World, I’m Julio Ochoa…</h1>
                 <div id="aboutMe">
                     <p>I am a Graphic and Website Designer offering services in print and web. I live in <a class="newTabLinks" target="new" href="http://www.coachella.org/">Coachella, California</a> and I will gladly do work here in my small town or anywhere in the United States. Hey I can take on the world, so where ever you are I will gladly work with you. I currently do freelance and enjoy working with people. 
                     </p>
                     <p>I attend the <a class="newTabLinks" target="new" href="http://www.artinstitutes.edu/inlandempire/">Art Institute of California - Inland Empire.</a> I am in my sixth quarter and I am filling myself with knowledge. The will to learn and better myself has never been greater. I am someone who breathes design. I enjoy producing creative design material for a range of clients. On occasions, I like doing personal experimental projects to better myself in designing new and unique material. I love to keep up to date on the design world, because it is always changing, along with the web. Going on new adventures and learning as much as possible is always a good challenge for me.
                     </p>
                     <h1>Getting Personal?</h1>
                     <p>When away from the computer I love playing music and creating new songs. As a musician and designer, creativity is my passion. I have been playing guitar for five years and have been making music for two years.I currently have produced and finished eight songs. Two of them are in English and six of them are in Spanish… why Spanish? I believe that Spanish lyrics have more meaning and the pronunciation of the language is incredible. In the upcoming future I will create a page on my portfolio just for my music, so be on the lookout for that. I play in two bands, and I just love and enjoy playing in live concerts. The adrenaline is what keeps me going and wanting for more.		 					 </p>
                     <p>I like to be around my family because I love them so much. We usually have a picnic on Sunday or we simply hang out and talk at home. I have two brothers and one sister that I've had great experiences with. I adore my big sister, we work part-time taking pictures together and create amazing compositions.</p>
                     <p>I also fix computers and I have a certificate in computer repair. There are many challenges with any computer, but no challenge I can’t handle.  If you are in the area feel free to <a class="link" href="contact.php" title="contact">contact me</a> if you have any computer problems.</p>
                     <p>Running is another hobby of mine. Whenever I have time to myself I go to <a class="newTabLinks" target="new" title="Bagdoma Park" href="http://www.coachella.org/index.aspx?NID=203">Bagdouma Park</a> and run a few laps. I put in about two miles a run and i love the feeling I get when I finish running; I feel free.</p>
